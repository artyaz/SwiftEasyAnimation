# SwiftEasyAnimation
This is a simple iOS application written in Swift that demonstrates how to perform animations using UIViews. The application uses a penguin image and a button to trigger different types of animations, such as scaling and transforming. This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn how to implement animations in iOS applications.
